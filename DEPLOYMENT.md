- **Logging**: Request/response logging

## 📚 API Documentation

Complete API documentation is available at `/api/docs` with:
- Interactive Swagger UI
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Role-based endpoint documentation

## 🔄 Business Logic

### Reservation Flow:
1. User reserves available book
2. Book status changes to 'reserved'
3. Reservation expires after 7 days
4. Admin can approve → convert to loan
5. Admin can cancel → book becomes available

### Loan Flow:
1. Admin creates loan (from reservation or directly)
2. Book status changes to 'borrowed'
3. Default 14-day loan period
4. System tracks overdue loans
5. Admin processes return → book becomes available

### Limits:
- Max 5 active reservations per user
- Max 3 active loans per user
- 7-day reservation expiry
- 14-day default loan period (configurable)
